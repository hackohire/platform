# Lilium, the Serverless GraphQL & MongoDB Boilerplate [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/flpStrri/Lilium.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/flpStrri/Lilium)

This code ~hype~ boilerplate was created to assist on the development of Node.js backend structures using the latest techologies stack / metodologies so its users can start with some already created momentum.

## How to use this boilerplate

To use Lilium, it is recommeded that you fork / clone the repository localy and use its strucutre on your application. Rewrite the domain objects for your case but use the already developed tests, repositories and services to increase the development speed.
Some services like database infrastructure and authorization will be wired so you can use it with minimal setup if you are on AWS. This setup will be presented [below](#deployment) as soon as we finish the first project cycle.

## Public domain

This project is in the worldwide [public domain](LICENSE). If you want to help us building Lilium, please start at our [CONTRIBUTING](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) document.

## How to run a localy

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js 8.10+](https://nodejs.org) installed on your computer.

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/flpStrri/Lilium
